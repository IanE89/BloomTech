How do we avoid just getting unlucky and selecting the wrong hyperparameter? This is a problem that to a certain degree we just have to live with as we test and test again. However, we can minimize it somewhat by pairing our experiments with Cross Validation to reduce the variance of our final accuracy values."

This approach is 100% manual and is pretty common among researchers, where finding that one exact specification of hyperparameter values that jumps your model to a level of accuracy never seen before is the difference between publishing and not publishing a paper. Of course the professors don't do this themselves, that's grunt work. This is also known as the \"fiddle with hyperparameters until you run out of time\" method.\n",

This has a specific downside in that if I specify 5 hyperparameters with 5 options each then I've just created $5^5 = 3125$ combinations of hyperparameters to check -- which means that I have to train $3125$ different versions of my model. Then if I use $5\\text{-fold}$ Cross Validation, I need five times as many runs, or $15,625$ runs.
